### Raspberry Pi Extra 4K Wallpapers

With the newer bookworm-based Raspberry Pi OS to accompany the Raspberry PI 5 SBC, there is a little extra package in the `Recommended Software`. You can now install Raspberry Pi Wallpaper 4K for that extra sharper and higher fildelity wallpapers if you are rocking a 4K monitor. I sure did.

The files are installed in the `/usr/share/rpd-wallpaper` folder.  

One of my favourite one is the RPiSystem wallpaper but it only comes in white. For the users wanting a dark version, here's it is:

Now you can have that perfect dark mode.
