### Law of Buy-In

People don't at first follow worthy causes. They follow worth leaders who promote causes  
they can believe in. People buy into the leader first, then the leader's vision.

During dot-com boom, it was observed that many times, the investors weren't even interested  
in finding out what the entrepreneur's vision was. If they'd bought into the person, then  
they readily accepted the ideas.

#### Buy-In Is a Process

1. They buy into your character
2. They buy into your competence
3. They buy into your commitment

If you consider the messenger to be credible, then you believe the message has value. That's  
one reason that actors and athletes are hired as promoters of products.

People want to go along with people they get along with.

As a leader, your success is measured by your ability to actually take the people where they  
need to go. But you can do that only if the people first buy into you.

### Law of Victory

#### Leaders Find Way for the team to win. 
They share an unwillingness to accept defeat. The alternative to winning is totally unacceptable  
to them.

> "What is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory - victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival?"   Winton Churchill

Leadership is responsible.
Losing is unacceptable.
Passion is unquenchable.
Creativity is essential.
Quitting is unthinkable.
Commitment is unquestionable.
Victory is inevitable.

#### Three Components of Victory
1. Unity of Vision
2. Diversity of skills
3. A leader dedicated to victory and raising players to their potential

Does that mean they always do win? No, of course not. But even a loss can be turned into
a win when you learn from it.

### The Law of the BIG MO

An organisation with no mementum is like a train at a dead stop. It's hard to get going, and even  
small wooden blocks on the tracks can keep it from going anywhere.

An organization with mememtum is like a train that's moving at sixty miles per hour. You could build  
a steel-reinforced concrete wall across the tracks, and the trian would plopw right through it.

1. Momentum is the great exaggerator
2. Momentum makes leaders look better than they are
3. Momemtum helps followers perform better than they are
4. Momentum is easier to steer than to start
5. Momentum is the most powerful change agent
6. Momentum is the Leader's Responsibilty
7. Momentum begins inside the leader


### The Law of Priorities

Leaders Understand that Activity is not neccessarily accomplishment

> "A leader is the one who climbs the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation and yells, 'Wrong jungle!'"

Follow the Pareto Principle. Focus your attention on the activities that rank in the top 20 percent  
in terms of importance, you will have an 80 percent return on your effort.

1. What is *r*equired of me?
2. What gives the greatest *r*eturn? 
```
Leaders should get out of the comfort zone but stay in their  
strength zone.

Just because you can do something does not mean that you should do it.

Leaders understand that activity is not neccessarily accomplishment. That's the Law of Priorities.
```
3. What brings the greatest reward?

> Life is too short not to do some things you love.

### The Law of Sacrifice

A Leader Must Give Up to Go Up

Sacrifice is an on-going process, not a one-time payment.

### The Law of Timing

Timing is everything.

1. The wrong action at the wrong time leads to diaster.
2. The right action at the wrong time brings resistance.
3. The wrong action at the right time is a mistake.
4. The right action at the right time results in success.

### The Law of Explosive Growth

#### To add Growth, Lead Followers - To Multiply, Lead Leaders.
