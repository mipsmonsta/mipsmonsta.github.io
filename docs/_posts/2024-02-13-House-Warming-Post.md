We all need to start somewhere are here is my start. Looking forward to be re-reading the first post and see that my aim of embarking on the blog is fulfiled.

## Digital fulfillment through learning

We are at an era where every human now has the ability to create and manipulate digital assets with easily available software tools - most open-sourced and easily assessible.

My **aim** with starting the blog are the following:

- Write more, to break out of my shell as I beefed up on my digital skillsets through my coding passion;
- Reflect more, to think deeper and take everyday learnings and bring out the essense and non-obvious; and
- Entertain more, to give meanings and stories to unconnected life's events and observations.

Yours,
*Mipsmonsta*
